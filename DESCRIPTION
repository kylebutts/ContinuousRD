Description: Implements the proposed estimator from Dong, Lee, and Gou (2022). 
    The setting is one in which the treatment of interest is continuous and the 
    regression discontinuity causes a shift in the treatment. The estimator performs
    this analysis at different percentiles of the treatment varible to allow for 
    heterogeneous effects.
